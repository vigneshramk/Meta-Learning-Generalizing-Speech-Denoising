ALL REGULAR TESTING FOR NOW


STEP 1. CREATE YOUR SPECTOGRAMS 
python CreateSpectograms.py --data_path ../path/to/timit/train --noise_type noisegoeshere --num_spect numberofspects

-noise types are
    babble
    engine
    factory1
    ops
    bucc

default specotgrams is 30 
if u did 30 spectograms, your data will be in MetaLearningSpeech/spectograms_train30/noise/NOISETYPEYOUCHOSE


STEP 2. TRAIN YOUR MODELS
I HARD CODED STUFF CUZ I WAS LAZY

if you want to train a model for just one noise type
python lstm_mask.py --train_lr .005 --num-epochs 51 --train_all 0 --noise_type babble --num_spectograms 30 --exp_name babble

-keep --train_all to be 0. change the noise_type, num-epochs and train_lr
--num_spectograms 30 - means that u created 30 spectograms for training set from CreateSpectograms.py
- the rest of the loading data will be found.
- change exp_name to somoething relevant. it will be the name of the training graph/model path
- most directories are split up by noise types

if u want to train a model on multiple noise types, u have to do some changing in the code....

python lstm_mask.py --train_lr .005 --num-epochs 51 --train_all 1 --num_spectograms 30 --exp_name all_train

- you change train_all 1
- you dont need to specify noise type since it will do all noise types now
- the rest is the same as before
- BUT U HAVE TO CHANGE WHICH NOISE TYPES TO TRAIN ON IN THE CODE
- LOOK UNDER MAIN
    if reg_train == 1: 
    ...
    ...
    all_noise=['factory1','babble' ....]

    THAT IS WHERE U ADD MORE NOISE TYPES. ADD WHATEVER NOISE TYPES U WANT TO TRAIN UR MODEL WITH BUT MAKE SURE THE SPECTOGRAM FILES EXIST
    It will save the model in a folder exp_name
    Make the exp_name give u a hint to what noise type you trained with 


STEP 3. TEST YOUR MODEL

python RegLSTMTest.py --noise_type babble --noise_snr -3 --model_directory models/lstm_mask_normal_train/babble/model_lstm.h5 --exp_name allbab0 --save_audio 0

you choose what noise type to test at
what snr to test at
directory that leads directly to your model 
exp_name is an attachment to the saved audio file. make it helpful


ALL TRAIN MODELS WILL BE IN 
models/lstm_mask_normal_train/exp_name_when_training

ALl TRAINING DATA WILL BE IN SPECTOGRAMS but you shouldnt need to worry about it

Figures are in figures/train_plots/noise_types
