
DNN based speech enhancement tool (developed by Dr. yong xu)

Note: Matlab should be installed in your PC first. Perl should be installed in your PC.
This zip contains the best DNN model trained by us.
This exe can be used to enhance any noisy speech, even from real world noisy speech!

Enhancing steps:

1 step0: clear all of the files in "wav_lsp", and then copy all of your noisy waveforms into "wav_lsp"

2 step1: in Matlab, JUST RUN "step1_DNNenh_for16kHz.m" without any parameters to be tuned and then all of the noisy waveforms will be obtained in "wav_lsp"
(There is a noisy 16kHz waveform in wav_lsp/timit_noisy_SNR5.wav  as an example)

or you can just click: step1_DNNenh_for16kHz.exe, everything will be done for you!




all is done!!!
